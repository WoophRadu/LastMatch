# LastMatch

LastMatch is a tool to quickly get the stats from your last match of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

## Don't use it yet

This is massively unfinished and right now it's hardcoded to only work for our CS:GO team. I am actively working on this and will make a build release once it is somewhat usable outside of our team.

## Builds

There are no builds yet, but there will be.

## Got feedback?

If you'd like to improve my ugly code, open an issue, I'll be happy to learn how to make things more organized and stuff.
